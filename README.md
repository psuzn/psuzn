# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Sujan, a software engineer living in Kathmandu, Nepal. I'm here on Github building stuff like [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals) (a multiplatform app to discover discounts on paid apps) and [WheelView](https://github.com/psuzn/WheelView).


# Things I work on
I get drawn to anything I spend some time playing with. This has led me to work on different technologies. I work on anything from native Android/iOS apps, backends(JVM/node), and database design and even built some mobile games along the way. 

I enjoy designing things from the ground up, involving and being part of all aspects of it. 

Right now I'm exploring [Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html).

# Current project

## Play Deals

![Feature](https://github.com/psuzn/Play-Deals/blob/develop/metadata/en-US/images/featureGraphic.png?raw=true)

I recently rewrote [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals) with [kotlin multiplatform(KMP)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html),and backend with [kotlin/vertx]([https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals](https://github.com/psuzn/Play-Deals-Backend). You can download native apps for Android, IOS, macOS, Windows and Linux. 


## Other open source work

### I am the author of

-  [`WheelView`](https://github.com/psuzn/WheelView): A small library to build custom choice wheels on android.

- [`ADB Wifi`](https://github.com/psuzn/ADB-WiFi) is an old app of mine. I made it a tool for myself to access the ADB interface wirelessly when we didn't have native support for it. We kind of have built-in support for wireless ADB (since Android 11) but some folks are still using it. 

- [`google-image-scrapper`](https://github.com/psuzn/google-image-scrapper) : Script to bulk down similar images using Google's reverse image search. 

### I am a contributor to

-   [`Kamel`](https://github.com/psuzn/Kamel): I contributed the [offline disk cache `(LRU based disk cache)`](https://github.com/Kamel-Media/Kamel/pull/61)

-   [`multiplatform-markdown-renderer`](https://github.com/mikepenz/multiplatform-markdown-renderer): I contributed to add the [support for generic image loaders]((https://github.com/mikepenz/multiplatform-markdown-renderer/pull/72)) and also [fixed the dynamic image size issue](https://github.com/mikepenz/multiplatform-markdown-renderer/pull/72).
