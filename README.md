# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Sujan, a software engineer living in Kathmandu, Nepal. I'm here on Github building stuff like [Kotlin Multiplatform Utils](https://github.com/psuzn/mp-utils) and [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals). 


# Things I work on
I get drawn to anything I spend some time playing with. This has led me to learn and work on different technologies over the years. I work on anything from native Android/IOS apps, and backends(JVM/node), and also do a little bit of database design and DevOps. I have even built some small mobile games along the way. I enjoy designing things from the ground up and being part of all aspects.

# Current Projects

## Multiplatform Utils 

[MP Utils](https://github.com/psuzn/mp-utils) is a collection of a few utility libraries for Kotlin Multiplatform that helps you to get app data/cache directories, identify the current platform and more. 

## Play Deals

[Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals) is a small multiplatform app built with kotlin multiplatform. It was a standalone Android app and I recently rewrote it with KMP. Now it supports Android, IOS, macOS, Windows and Linux. 

The [backend](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals-backend) (built with [kotlin/vertx](https://vertx.io/)) and the [web scraper](https://github.com/psuzn/deals-scrapper) (built with [GoLang](https://go.dev/)) are also open spurce. 


## Other open source work

### I am the author of

-  [`deals-scrapper`](https://github.com/psuzn/deals-scrapper): Deals scrapper written in golang to scrap deals from the web.

-  [`WheelView`](https://github.com/psuzn/WheelView): A small library to build custom choice wheels on android.

- [`ADB Wifi`](https://github.com/psuzn/ADB-WiFi) is an old app of mine. I made it a tool for myself to access the ADB interface wirelessly when we didn't have native support for it. We kind of have built-in support for wireless ADB (since Android 11) but some folks are still using it. 

- [`google-image-scrapper`](https://github.com/psuzn/google-image-scrapper) : Script to bulk down similar images using Google's reverse image search. 

### I am a contributor to

-   [`Kamel`](https://github.com/psuzn/Kamel): I added support for the [offline disk cache `(LRU based disk cache)`](https://github.com/Kamel-Media/Kamel/pull/61)

-   [`multiplatform-markdown-renderer`](https://github.com/mikepenz/multiplatform-markdown-renderer): I contributed to add the [support for generic image loaders](https://github.com/mikepenz/multiplatform-markdown-renderer/pull/72) and also [fixed the dynamic image size issue](https://github.com/mikepenz/multiplatform-markdown-renderer/pull/72).
