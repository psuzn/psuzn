# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Sujan, software engineer living in the Kathmandu, Nepal. I'm here on Github building stuff like [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals), a multiplatform app to discover paid apps or free or discount.


# Things I work on
I get drawn to anything I spend some time playing with. This has lead me to work on different technologies. I have worked on anything from native android/ios apps, backends, database design and even have built some mobile games along the ways. 

I enjoy designing the products from ground up, involving and being part of all the aspect of it. 

Right now I'm exploring [Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html).

# Current project

## Play Deals

I recently rewrote [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals) with [kotlin multiplatform(KMP)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html). It supports Android, IOS, macOs, Windows and Linux.
