# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Sujan, a software engineer living in Kathmandu, Nepal. I'm here on Github building stuff like [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals) and [Multiplatform Paths](https://github.com/psuzn/mp-utils). 

# Things I work on
I work on anything from native Android/IOS apps, and backends(JVM/node), and I also do some database design and DevOps. I have even built some small mobile games along the way. I enjoy designing things from the ground up and being part of all aspects. 

## Open Source Work

### I am the author of : 

* [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals) : A multiplatform app built with kotlin multiplatform that lists out paid apps that have a sale or discount on Google Play Store and has over 20k downloads on Google Play Store.
  * [Play Deals Backend](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals) : Backend for [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals). 
  * [Deals Scrapper](https://github.com/psuzn/deals-scrapper) : Deals scrapper written in Golang to scrap deals from the web (a microservice for [Play Deals](https://github.com/psuzn/play-deals) ).
* [Multiplatform Paths](https://github.com/psuzn/multiplatform-paths) : Kotin Multiplatform library to get platform-specific app data and cache directories.
* [Wheel View](https://github.com/psuzn/WheelView) : A small library to build custom choice wheels on Android.
* [ADB Wifi](https://github.com/psuzn/ADB-WiFi) is an old app of mine. I made it a tool to access the ADB interface wirelessly when we didn't have native support. We kind of have built-in support for wireless ADB (since Android 11) but some folks are still using it.
* [Google Image Scrapper](https://github.com/psuzn/google-image-scrapper) : Script to bulk down similar images using Google's reverse image search.

  * Added the new [UnusedVariable Rule](https://github.com/detekt/detekt/pull/7089) and
